/*
Much like singly linked lists, a doubly linked list is comprised of multiple ListNode objects.
Again, each ListNode object has a value and a pointer to the next node.
However, where doubly linked lists differ is that they also have a pointer to the previous node.
This allows for bidirectional traversal of the list, as well as simplifying the deletion logic.

Where we decide to use a singly or doubly linked list will depend on the specific use case, and we 
should consider how our linked list will be applied in our program.
